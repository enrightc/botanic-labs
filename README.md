## 5.3 Database Schema
To create a clear visual representation of the database, I used **Lucid Chart** to build a Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This diagram served as a reference throughout the development process, providing a clear visual representation of the database structure and the relationship between components of the website. Through the development process I continuously updated the ERD to ensure it aligned with the overall design of Bontanic Labs. 

![Entity-relationship Diagram](botanic_labs/media/docs/wireframes/Database_ER_diagram.jpeg)

Although at this stage wishlist and review functionality has not yet been implemented I have left these in the ERD to show the planned future expansion of Botanic Labs, providing a roadmap for how these features can be integrated

### Conclusions from the ERD

1. **User-Centric Design:**
   - The database design centres around user interactions, linking users to profiles and orders. While wishlist and review features are planned for future additions, they have been included in the design for easier integration later. This anticipates user needs as the platform grows.

2. **Organised Product Management:**
   - The product model is structured to include various attributes such as type, season, soil drainage, lifespan, and light exposure. This allows for detailed filtering and helps users find products that match their needs. The option to link up to three recommended products provides users with suggestions, enhancing the browsing experience.

3. **Simple Order Handling:**
   - Orders are organised with individual line items, allowing multiple products per order. This setup ensures accurate order processing and inventory management, as well as facilitating customer support by detailing each product within an order.

4. **Admin-Controlled Article Creation:**
   - The article model is linked to the user model for authorship, with only admin users permitted to add content. This provides a controlled environment for content creation, ensuring high-quality and relevant information is shared with users through articles.

5. **Independent FAQs for Flexibility:**
   - The FAQ section is designed as a standalone model, allowing it to be managed and updated independently of other parts of the database. This is beneficial for quick adjustments and additions without impacting the core user or product data. Only admin can add/edit FAQs. 

6. **Scalability and Expansion:**
   - By planning for wishlist and review models, the database is prepared for future features without the need for significant structural changes. This supports potential growth and additional functionality as user engagement increases.

7. **Reliable Data Connections:**
   - Foreign key relationships ensure secure and reliable connections between models, such as users with profiles and orders with line items. This setup enhances data integrity and consistency across the platform, supporting a smooth user experience and effective data management.

Overall, the ERD for Botanic Labs provides a solid foundation for current features while allowing for future growth by adding wishlists and reviews functionality. It enables a personalised shopping experience, straightforward content management, and flexible product handling, ensuring that both user and admin needs are effectively met.

### Profile Management:
- Logged-in users can access their profile to:
  - View and update their default delivery information
  - See their order history

### Exploring Articles:
- Users can navigate to the **Articles** section from the main menu.
- They can read various articles related to gardening and flowers.

### Checking FAQs:
- Users can access the **FAQ** section from the main menu.
- Here, they can find answers to common questions about products and services.

### Admin Functions:
- Superusers have additional options for:
  - **Product Management:** Add, edit, or delete products
  - **Article Management:** Add, edit, or delete articles

# 6.0  SKELETON
## 6.1 Wireframes
Prior to commencing the website coding process, wireframes were produced for each page using Figma - a design tool used for creating user interfaces, prototypes, and wireframes. These wireframes served as the initial blueprints, providing a visual roadmap for the website's layout and structure.

It's important to note that while the final web pages evolved from these early plans, some deviations were intentionally made to enhance the user experience and align better with the project's goals.

This iterative process allowed for flexibility in adapting to evolving project requirements, ultimately contributing to the development of a more refined and user-friendly website.

# BUGS
**User Profile Not Attached to Orders in Webhook Handling**

Issue: When capturing a payment via Stripe webhooks (e.g., by commenting out the form submission process to simulate a user closing the page before submission), the user_profile was not being attached to the order, even though the payment was successfully processed. The issue was caused by placing user_profile=profile in the wrong location within the webhook handler code.

Solution: The user_profile assignment was mistakenly placed within the section of the code that verifies if an order already exists, rather than in the section where a new order is created. Moving user_profile=profile to the correct location in the code, where the new order is created, ensured that user profiles are correctly attached to new orders processed through the webhook.

Outcome: After correcting the code placement, the user_profile is now correctly attached to orders, whether processed via the form submission or handled directly through Stripe webhooks. This allows user order history and profile data to function as expected in both cases.

**AttributeError When Using .split() on a NoneType Object in Product Recommendations**
Issue: An error occurred when adding new products due to an attempt to call the .split() method on a NoneType object while processing the recommendations field in the Product model.

Cause: The issue arose because the recommendations field was initially a CharField that could be left empty. When the field was empty, it was stored as None, and trying to call .split() on a NoneType value resulted in an error. The database was originally set up to allow admin users to enter recommendations as a string using product primary key (PK) numbers, with products separated by commas.

Solution: The Product model was refactored to improve usability by allowing admin users to select specific product recommendations instead of manually entering comma-separated strings. The recommendations field was replaced with three separate ForeignKey fields to allow relational selection of recommended products:

![Recommendations](botanic_labs/media/docs/wireframes/recommendations.png)

**Issue with Form Submission Using CKEditor**
Issue: After implementing CKEditor, the form was not submitting correctly when all required fields were filled, leading to form validation issues.

Cause: The issue stemmed from CKEditor not properly updating the content of the hidden textarea field when submitting the form. As a result, the form's content field appeared empty, causing validation errors.

Solution: The issue was resolved by switching to Summernote, a different rich text editor that integrates better with Django forms, preventing the submission issues encountered with CKEditor.
